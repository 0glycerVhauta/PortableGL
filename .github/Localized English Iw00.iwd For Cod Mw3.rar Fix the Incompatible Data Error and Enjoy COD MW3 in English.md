If you have downloaded Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (COD MW3) from a Russian source, you may have encountered a problem with the language settings. The game may be in Russian instead of English, which can make it hard to play and enjoy. Fortunately, there is a way to fix this issue by installing a localized English file called Iw00.iwd.
 
Iw00.iwd is a file that contains the text and voice data for the game. By replacing the Russian version of this file with the English one, you can change the language of the game to English. Here are the steps to do this:
 
**Download ★★★ [https://kneedacexbrew.blogspot.com/?d=2uEoN9](https://kneedacexbrew.blogspot.com/?d=2uEoN9)**


 
1. Download the localized English Iw00.iwd file from one of these links: [Wupload](https://www.wupload.com/folder/1303712), [Filesonic](http://www.filesonic.com/folder/14491875), or [Filepost](http://filepost.com/folder/c9467165/). The file name should be Localized English Iw00.iwd For Cod Mw3.rar.
2. Extract the file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should get a folder called main.
3. Copy the folder main and paste it into your COD MW3 installation directory, which is usually C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\call of duty modern warfare 3. If you are asked to overwrite or merge files, click yes.
4. Start the game and enjoy it in English.

Note: This method only works for COD MW3 on PC. If you have the game on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, or Wii, you will need to buy or download an English version of the game.

If you want to change the language back to Russian, you will need to restore the original Iw00.iwd file. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to your COD MW3 installation directory, which is usually C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\call of duty modern warfare 3.
2. Open the folder main and find the file localized\_english\_iw00.iwd. Rename it to something else, like localized\_english\_iw00.bak.
3. Copy the file localized\_russian\_iw00.iwd from the same folder and paste it in another location, like your desktop.
4. Rename the copied file to localized\_english\_iw00.iwd and move it back to the main folder.
5. Start the game and it should be in Russian.

Note: This method only works for COD MW3 on PC. If you have the game on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, or Wii, you will need to buy or download a Russian version of the game.
  
If you want to change the language to another one, you will need to find and download the corresponding Iw00.iwd file for that language. For example, if you want to play the game in French, you will need the localized\_french\_iw00.iwd file. You can search for these files online or ask other players who have them.
 
Once you have the file, you will need to repeat the same steps as before, but with the new file. For example, if you want to change the language from English to French, you will need to do this:

1. Go to your COD MW3 installation directory, which is usually C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\call of duty modern warfare 3.
2. Open the folder main and find the file localized\_english\_iw00.iwd. Rename it to something else, like localized\_english\_iw00.bak.
3. Copy the file localized\_french\_iw00.iwd from another source and paste it in the main folder.
4. Rename the copied file to localized\_english\_iw00.iwd.
5. Start the game and it should be in French.

Note: This method only works for COD MW3 on PC. If you have the game on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, or Wii, you will need to buy or download a version of the game that supports your desired language.
