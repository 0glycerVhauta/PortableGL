Another standout track is "Waiting for the Miracle", which was featured in the 1994 film Natural Born Killers. The song is a dark and cynical commentary on the state of the world and the human condition. Cohen sings about the futility of waiting for a miracle to save us from ourselves, while acknowledging that we are still drawn to the idea of salvation. The song has a hypnotic and ominous melody, enhanced by Cohen's deep and gravelly voice.
 
Essential Leonard Cohen (cd2) also includes some of Cohen's more uplifting and hopeful songs, such as "Dance Me to the End of Love" and "Closing Time". The former is a romantic and passionate song inspired by Cohen's relationship with actress Rebecca De Mornay. The latter is a playful and celebratory song about enjoying life and having fun. Both songs showcase Cohen's lighter and more humorous side, as well as his musical versatility.
